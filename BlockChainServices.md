## TAU blockchain services include three threads
* republish both mutable and immutable item
* voting the consensus piont and mining a block
* collecting tx from other peers

## When a node is off-line too long such as over the Warning Range, then give up the history data on the chain. 
* In the future upgrade, we can keep history data for less downloading effort and as well for searching purpose.
