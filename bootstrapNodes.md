TAU will leverage existing bittorent network to bootstrap. 
Nodes to use:
- 1. official torrent bootstrap nodes such as router.utorrent.com and router.bittorrent.com 
- 2. other nodes with 6881 port open on public network. TAU will collect these information from network and put these into software to help bootstrap clents.
