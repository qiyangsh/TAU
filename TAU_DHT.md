# TAU DHT extention to libtorrent/bittorrent mainline dht (bep 44)
## draft 0.01
The purpose of the extention is to modify Mainline DHT to suitable for blockchain applications. 
The current mainline DHT does not specify the strategy for republish and value schema for both mutable and immutable item. In order to operate a decentralized app, the value schema need to be define to represent things like blocks or images. To optimize seeking of a item, we need better searching protocol to suite mobile network. 
 
The global TAU DHT network is viewed as collabortive **"memory"** of the ultimate global computer, storage of each personal devices will exchange data between "memory" and local disk. However, a latest state traverse of a community peers will incur O(N) level complexity, which is not ideal for decentralized apps. Through each peer's knowledge on lastest state changes, it is possible to reduce traversal complexity to O(logN).  This idea inherits from Dynamic Programming course of MIT 6.006, Prof. Erik Demaine. <br>
Innovations:
* in Mutable item: include another public key in the value for traverse the dht under same salt.
* in Immutable item: implement republish of a related immutable item either on the same chain or part of same image or video.

Mutable item key: publicKey + salt
- Mutable item value: immutable item key (the hash of a chat message, block content or image)
- Mutable item search optimization strategy:  
  - while self generation, value is an key of immutable item, that is put by self. 
  - when not generate content, value is an key of immtable hash generated by other senders.
- Republish function: disabled. 

Immutable item key: hash of content
- Immutable item value: chain block, chat message, image schema such as IPLD
- Republish function: when read an immutable item, the node will always put another immutable item under same schema. 
- Immutable item data schema: block, chat message, image, etc, such as IPLD

invite link schema:  salt + sender PK + receiver PK
salt schema: chainID#channel; chatgroupID#channel;
